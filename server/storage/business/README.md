# Business Storage Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored business storage system, broken down into focused, maintainable modules.

## Module Structure

### `business-queries.ts`
- **Purpose**: Database query building and execution
- **Key Features**:
  - SQL query building with filters
  - Result transformation to BusinessWithCategory format
  - Single business retrieval by ID or slug
  - Raw SQL query execution with proper error handling

### `business-validation.ts`
- **Purpose**: Data validation and sanitization
- **Key Features**:
  - Data sanitization (removes undefined values)
  - SEO slug generation
  - SEO metadata generation
  - Business data validation
  - Email and URL format validation

### `business-operations.ts`
- **Purpose**: Core CRUD operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Create, update, delete businesses
  - Unique slug generation
  - SEO metadata auto-generation
  - Bulk operations
  - Featured/verification status updates

### `business-search.ts`
- **Purpose**: Search and filtering capabilities
- **Key Features**:
  - Advanced business filtering
  - Featured business retrieval
  - Random business selection
  - Location-based searches
  - Business statistics
  - City-based filtering

### `index.ts`
- **Purpose**: Main facade class that coordinates all modules
- **Key Features**:
  - Acts as a single entry point for all business operations
  - Delegates to appropriate specialized modules
  - Maintains the same public API as the original BusinessStorage class

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Testability**: Smaller modules are easier to unit test
4. **Reusability**: Modules can be used independently
5. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality
6. **Performance**: Optimized queries and operations per module

## Usage

The refactored system maintains the same public API as the original BusinessStorage class:

```typescript
import { storage } from "../storage";

// All existing methods work the same way
const businesses = await storage.getBusinesses({ categoryId: 1 });
const business = await storage.getBusinessById("some-id");
const created = await storage.createBusiness(businessData);
```

## Migration Notes

- The original `business-storage.ts` has been backed up as `business-storage-backup.ts`
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the public API
- TypeScript errors in the original file have been addressed in the refactored modules

## File Dependencies

```
business/
├── index.ts                 (Main facade - imports all modules)
├── business-queries.ts      (Database operations)

├── business-operations.ts   (CRUD operations)
├── business-search.ts       (Search & filtering)
└── README.md               (This documentation)
```

## Error Handling

Each module includes proper error handling:
- Database errors are caught and logged
- Validation errors are thrown with descriptive messages
- Fallback values are provided where appropriate
- All async operations include try-catch blocks

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to add new features:
- Additional search filters
- Caching strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Analytics tracking
- Audit logging
