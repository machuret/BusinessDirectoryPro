# Admin Link Protection System

## Problem Analysis: Why Admin Links Break

1. **Route Conflicts**: Frontend routes conflicting with backend API routes
2. **Authentication Middleware**: Session invalidation breaking protected routes  
3. **URL Generation**: Hardcoded URLs becoming stale when routes change
4. **Navigation State**: Lost navigation context during page refreshes
5. **Base URL Changes**: Deployment environment URL changes breaking relative links

## Comprehensive Protection Strategy

### 1. Route Stability System
- Centralized route definitions
- Version-locked admin URLs
- Automatic conflict detection
- Fallback route handling

### 2. Authentication Persistence
- Session restoration on page load
- Token refresh mechanisms
- Graceful authentication failures
- Protected route redirection

### 3. Dynamic Link Generation
- API-based route discovery
- Environment-aware URL building
- Automatic base URL detection
- Cache invalidation on changes

### 4. Navigation Resilience
- State persistence across refreshes
- Breadcrumb trail maintenance
- Last known good route storage
- Error boundary recovery
