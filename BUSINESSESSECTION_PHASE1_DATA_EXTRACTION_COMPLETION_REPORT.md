## Phase 1 Achievements

### ✅ Data Logic Extraction Complete

**Custom Hooks Created:**
1. **useBusinessEditor.ts** (249 lines)
   - Centralizes all business editing functionality
   - Manages form state, validation, and submission
   - Handles FAQ management (add, update, remove)
   - Manages image upload and gallery operations
   - Integrates review data fetching
   - Provides comprehensive error handling with toast notifications

2. **useUserBusinesses.ts** (49 lines)
   - Manages user business data presentation
   - Provides helper functions for business status and ratings
   - Centralizes notification management
   - Offers debugging utilities

### ✅ Component Transformation

**Before Refactoring:**
- 604 lines of mixed UI and business logic
- Complex state management scattered throughout component
- Difficult to test and maintain
- Poor separation of concerns

**After Refactoring:**
- 398 lines focused purely on UI rendering
- Clean hook-based architecture
- Clear separation between data logic and presentation
- Comprehensive TSDoc documentation following gold standard

### ✅ Documentation Standards Applied

**Gold Standard TSDoc Implementation:**
```typescript
/**
 * BusinessesSection - Main dashboard component for business owners to manage their business listings
 * 
 * Provides a comprehensive interface for business owners to view and edit their business information,
 * including basic details, contact information, photos, reviews, and FAQs. Utilizes dedicated custom
 * hooks for data management and state handling to maintain clean separation of concerns.
 * 
 * @param businesses - Array of businesses owned by the current user with category information
 * @param isLoading - Loading state indicating whether business data is being fetched
 * 
 * @returns JSX.Element - A responsive card containing business table with edit functionality and modal dialogs
 * 
 * @example
 * // Basic usage in dashboard
 * <BusinessesSection 
 *   businesses={userBusinesses}
 *   isLoading={businessQuery.isLoading}
 * />
 */
```

  addFaq: () => void;
  updateFaq: (index: number, field: 'question' | 'answer', value: string) => void;
  removeFaq: (index: number) => void;
  
  // Image management
  businessImages: string[];
  uploadingImages: boolean;
  handleFileUpload: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => Promise<void>;
  removeImage: (imageUrl: string) => void;

## Future Integration Points

### Phase 2: UI Component Extraction
Next phase will extract UI components from the remaining 398 lines:
- `BusinessTable.tsx` - Table rendering logic
- `BusinessEditModal.tsx` - Modal dialog component
- `BusinessEditTabs.tsx` - Tabbed interface
- `BusinessFormFields.tsx` - Form input components
