# DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

## Problem Identified
The `vercel.json` configuration was preventing the actual React build from running. Vercel was deploying an empty output directory, causing 404 errors.

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` to use `@vercel/static-build` preset which will:
1. Run `npm run build` command from package.json
2. Execute the Vite build process
3. Generate proper static assets
4. Deploy the React application correctly

## Current Configuration
- **API**: Serverless function at `/api/index.js` 
- **Frontend**: Static build with Vite at `/client/dist`
- **Build Process**: Vercel will now execute the actual React build

## Next Steps
1. Push updated code to GitHub
2. Deploy on Vercel (build will now take longer than 1 second)
3. Verify the React application loads properly

The build process will now properly transpile, bundle, and optimize your React application.
