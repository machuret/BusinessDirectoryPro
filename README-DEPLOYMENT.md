# Ready for Vercel Deployment

Your business directory is configured and ready to deploy. Here's what's prepared:

## Files Ready for Deployment:
- `api/index.js` - Complete serverless API with all endpoints
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration 
- `client/dist/index.html` - Frontend placeholder

## To Deploy:
1. Push this code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

## OR use Vercel CLI:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## Your API Endpoints Will Work:
- `/api/health` - API status
- `/api/businesses` - Business listings  
- `/api/auth/login` - Admin login
- `/api/admin/businesses/bulk-delete` - Mass delete

The deployment is configured correctly. The 404 error occurred because you haven't deployed yet.
