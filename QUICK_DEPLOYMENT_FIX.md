# Quick Deployment Fix

Your deployment is showing a fallback page instead of your real app. Here's the immediate fix:

## For Replit Deployment (Immediate Fix):

1. **Run this command in the Shell:**
   ```bash
   cd client && npm run build
   ```
   (This will take 2-3 minutes - let it complete)

2. **After build completes, restart your deployment**

3. **Make sure NODE_ENV=production is set in your deployment settings**

## For Vercel Deployment:

Update your `package.json` scripts section to include:
```json
"build:server": "esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=cjs --outfile=dist/index.js",
"build:client": "cd client && vite build --outDir ../server/public"
```

Then push to GitHub and Vercel will rebuild.

## Why This Happens:

- Your app serves a fallback page when production files are missing
- The build process creates these files in `server/public`
- Once built, your real business directory will appear

## Alternative Quick Test:

Run this in Shell to see if it works:
```bash
cd client && npm run build && cd .. && NODE_ENV=production npm start
```
