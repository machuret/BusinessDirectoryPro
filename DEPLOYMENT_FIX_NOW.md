# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT FIX

Your deployment shows a placeholder page because the React build files are missing from `server/public`.

## Quick Fix (Do This Now):

### Option 1: Build Locally & Upload
1. On your local machine, run:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```
2. Upload the contents of `client/dist/*` to `server/public/` in your Replit

### Option 2: Use Development Mode
Change your Replit deployment to run in development mode:
1. In Replit, go to deployment settings
2. Change the run command to: `npm run dev`
3. This will use the development server which works

### Option 3: Reduce Package Count
The build times out because you have 1289 packages. To fix:
1. Remove unused dependencies
2. Use a CDN for large libraries
3. Split the build into smaller chunks

## Why This Happens:
- Your preview works because it uses Vite development server
- Your deployment fails because it needs built files in `server/public`
- The build process times out due to too many packages

## Permanent Solution:
Move to Vercel deployment (already configured in your repo) which handles large builds better.
