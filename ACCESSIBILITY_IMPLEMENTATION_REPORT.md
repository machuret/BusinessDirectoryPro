## Technical Implementation Details

### 🔧 **Core Components Created**

#### **1. Focus Management Hook (`useFocusManagement.ts`)**
```typescript
// Comprehensive focus management for modals and interactive components
export function useFocusManagement({
  isOpen,
  restoreFocus = true,
  trapFocus = true,
  initialFocusSelector
}: UseFocusManagementOptions)
```

**Features:**
- Automatic focus movement to modals when opened
- Focus trapping within modal boundaries using Tab navigation
- Focus restoration to trigger element when modal closes
- Escape key handling for modal dismissal
- Custom initial focus targeting with selectors

#### **2. Accessible Tab Group (`TabGroup.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Full keyboard navigation with ARIA compliance
export function TabGroup({ 
  tabs, 
  defaultTab, 
  onChange, 
  orientation = 'horizontal'
}: TabGroupProps)
```

**Keyboard Support:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between tabs (respects horizontal/vertical orientation)
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last tab
- **Enter/Space**: Activate selected tab
- **Tab**: Move focus out of tab group
- **Disabled State**: Skip disabled tabs in navigation

**ARIA Implementation:**
- `role="tablist"` and `role="tab"` semantics
- `aria-selected` and `aria-controls` relationships
- `tabindex` management for proper focus order

#### **3. Enhanced Modal Component (`AccessibleModal.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Modal with complete accessibility features
export function AccessibleModal({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  title,
  description,
  closeOnEscape = true,
  trapFocus = true
}: AccessibleModalProps)
```

**Accessibility Features:**
- `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` semantics
- `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` relationships
- Focus trapping with tab cycling
- Escape key dismissal
- Click-outside closing with proper event handling
- Screen reader announcements

#### **4. Skip Navigation System (`SkipNavigation.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Bypass navigation for keyboard users
export function SkipNavigation()
```

**Navigation Links:**
- Skip to main content (`#main-content`)
- Skip to navigation (`#navigation`) 
- Skip to search (`#search`)
- Visually hidden until focused
- Proper focus indicators and styling

## Business Card Accessibility Enhancements

### 🖼️ **Image Accessibility**
**Before:**
```typescript
<img src={displayImage} alt={business.title || 'Business'} />
```

**After:**
```typescript
<img 
  src={displayImage}
  alt={`${business.title} - ${business.category?.name || 'Business'} located in ${business.address || 'local area'}`}
  className="w-full h-48 object-cover"
/>
```

**Improvement:** Descriptive alt text provides context about business type and location for screen readers.

### 🔘 **Button Accessibility**
**Before:**
```typescript
<Button variant="outline" size="icon">
  <Phone className="w-4 h-4" />
</Button>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<Button 
  variant="outline"
  size="icon"
  aria-label={`Call ${business.title} at ${business.phone}`}
>
  <Phone className="w-4 h-4" aria-hidden="true" />
  <span className="sr-only">Call Business</span>
</Button>
```

**Improvements:**
- `aria-label` provides context for screen readers
- `aria-hidden="true"` prevents icon from being announced
- `sr-only` span ensures screen reader users understand the action
