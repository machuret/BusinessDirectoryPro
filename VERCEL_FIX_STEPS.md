# ðŸ”§ Vercel Fix - Ready to Deploy!

## What I Fixed:
The build was failing because it couldn't find `client/index.html`. I've updated vercel.json with the correct build commands.

## Steps to Deploy:

### 1. Push the Updated vercel.json
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build command"
git push origin main
```

### 2. In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your failed deployment
2. Click "Redeploy" or "Retry Build"
3. It should work now!

## What the Fix Does:
- Changes to client directory before building
- Builds the React app correctly
- Copies files to server/public
- Builds the backend API

## If It Still Fails:
The build might timeout due to 1289 packages. If so, we can:
1. Use a simpler build approach
2. Pre-build locally and push the built files
3. Or reduce dependencies

Your deployment should work now. Just push the changes and redeploy!
