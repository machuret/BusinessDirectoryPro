# Fix Vercel Deployment

## Problem: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND
The URL `business-directory-pro-gmachu.vercel.app` doesn't exist because the deployment failed or wasn't created.

## Solution: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Login to Vercel:**
```bash
vercel login
```

3. **Deploy from this directory:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

4. **Follow prompts:**
- Project name: `business-directory-pro`
- Settings: Use defaults
- Deploy: Yes

## Alternative: GitHub Integration
1. Push this code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com â†’ New Project
3. Import from GitHub
4. Deploy

Your files are ready:
- API: `api/index.js` (working)
- Frontend: `client/dist/index.html` (working)
- Config: `vercel.json` (correct)

The issue is deployment hasn't happened yet.
