Excellent! This new build log gives us the exact information we need. You are **extremely close** to a successful deployment.

Let's break down the log. The good news is that your build is running correctly now. The bad news is that the final step is failing because of a folder name conflict.

### The Analysis: A Tale of Two `dist` Folders

1.  **The Build Runs:** The log clearly shows `Running "npm run build"` followed by your combined command: `vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ...` This is a huge step forward!

2.  **Vite Builds the Frontend:** The log shows `vite v5.4.14 building for production...` and then lists all your frontend assets (`.js`, `.css` files). It successfully creates the frontend part of your application.

3.  **Esbuild Builds the Backend:** Immediately after the Vite build, the log shows the output of your `esbuild` command: `dist/index.js 381.1kb`. This successfully creates the backend server code.

4.  **The Fatal Error:** The final line is the key:
    * **`[20:09:11.344] Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found after the Build completed.`**

This seems contradictory, right? How can it not find a `dist` directory when `esbuild` just created one?

Hereâ€™s the problem: Your build command creates **two different outputs**, and Vercel gets confused.
* Your `esbuild` command creates a `dist` folder at the project root for your server (`/dist/index.js`).
* Your `vite build` command is likely configured to *also* create a `dist` folder (or is placing its files in a non-standard location like `../dist/public/` as shown in the file paths).
* Your `vercel.json` is telling Vercel: "After the build, find the static frontend code in a root folder named `dist`." When Vercel looks inside `/dist`, it only sees your backend server file (`index.js`), not the `index.html` it expects for a frontend application. This causes the error.

### The Solution: Separate Outputs & Zero-Configuration

The best practice on Vercel is to build your frontend and backend to the locations that Vercel expects by default. This allows you to leverage its powerful **zero-configuration** deployments.

Here is the cleanest way to fix this:

#### Step 1: Modify your `package.json` Build Script

Change your build script to output the backend code to the Vercel-standard `/api` directory.

```json
// In your package.json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=api"
},
```
* The only change here is at the very end: **`--outdir=api`**.

#### Step 2: Modify your `vite.config.ts` (or `.js`)

Explicitly tell Vite to build your frontend application into a directory named `public`. This is a clean, standard name for static web assets.

```typescript
// In your vite.config.ts (or .js)
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    // This is the important part
    outDir: 'public' 
  }
})
```

#### Step 3: Delete `vercel.json`

Your `vercel.json` file is currently overriding Vercel's smart defaults. Since we are now building to the locations Vercel expects automatically, you no longer need it.

* **Delete the `vercel.json` file from your project.**

#### Step 4: Configure the Vercel Dashboard

With `vercel.json` gone, the dashboard settings will now apply.

1.  Go to your Vercel project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to **Settings > General**.
3.  Set the **Output Directory** to `public`.
4.  Ensure the **Build Command** is `npm run build`.

### What Will Happen Now

When you push these changes and redeploy:
1.  `npm run build` will run.
2.  Vite will build your frontend and place it in a `/public` folder.
3.  Esbuild will build your backend and place it in an `/api` folder.
4.  Vercel will see the `/public` folder and serve it as your static site (matching your dashboard setting).
5.  Vercel will **automatically** detect the `/api` folder and deploy `index.js` as a serverless function.

This approach is simpler, more robust, and aligns perfectly with how Vercel is designed to work.

#### **Bonus Tip: Code Cleanup**
The warnings in your log about duplicate keys (`skipLibCheck`, `getSocialMediaLinks`, etc.) are not breaking the build, but you should clean them up.
* **`tsconfig.json`:** Remove the duplicate `skipLibCheck` line.
* **`server/storage/content-storage.ts`:** You have several functions defined twice in this class. Find and remove the duplicates to avoid potential bugs.
