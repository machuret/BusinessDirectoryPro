 want you to act as a senior software architect who is auditing our project for the very first time. Your goal is to provide a high-level assessment of the project's overall health, structure, and maintainability. You have no prior history with this codebase.

To do this, I will provide you with the contents of key files as you request them (like package.json, README.md, folder structure listings, and key source code files).

Please generate a "First Impressions Report" that answers the following questions:

1. Project Clarity & Onboarding:

Based on the README.md, how clear is the project's purpose? Can you immediately tell what it does?
How clear are the setup and installation instructions for a new developer?
2. Developer Experience (DevEx):

Review the scripts in package.json. Are they standard and easy to understand (e.g., dev, build, test)?
Is there an .env.example file to guide environment variable setup? How easy would it be for someone to get the project running locally?
3. Technology Stack:

Analyze the package.json dependencies. What are the core frameworks and major libraries being used?
Are there any obvious red flags, such as outdated, deprecated, or known problematic packages?
4. Codebase Architecture:

Describe the project's folder structure. Does it seem organized? Does it follow a recognizable pattern (e.g., feature-based, domain-driven)?
Is there a clear separation of concerns (e.g., frontend vs. backend, components vs. pages, business logic vs. UI)?
5. Code Quality & Consistency:

Is there evidence of code quality tools like ESLint and Prettier being used?
Based on a representative component file I'll provide, does the code seem clean, readable, and internally consistent?
6. Testing Strategy:

What is the apparent testing strategy? Scan the file structure for test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts, etc.).
What testing libraries are being used (e.g., Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, Cypress)? What is the general sense of the test coverage?
Conclusion & Recommendations:

Based on all the above, provide an overall Project Health Score (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair, or Needs Attention).
