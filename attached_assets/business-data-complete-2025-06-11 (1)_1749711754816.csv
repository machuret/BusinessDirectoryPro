Book yourself in with Alex and the folks at Kedron Family Dental.\n\nDr Alex is kind, thorough and adopts a holistic approach to his dentistry. For example, he took the time to check my neck, jaw and lymph nodes, which surprised me as no dentist has ever done that before.\n\nAlex also asked thoughtful questions about my diet and carefully explained the effect of acidic drinks on the entire digestive process, not just my now oh-so-sensitive chompers. He also accommodated a long overdue filling without removing an organ to pay for it.\n\nDo I regret all the water with lemon juice (#health) that I've been guzzling recently? Yes.\n\nDo I regret my trip to KFD? No. Quite an enjoyable morning all round.\n\nBook yourself in!"",""stars"":5,""rating"":null,""reviewId"":""ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJMnN6LS1nRRAB"",""publishAt"":""a month ago"",""reviewUrl"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJMnN6LS1nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xf0d0c21e535ccc66!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCI2sz--gE%7CCgsIgsauvwYQ8I3vMg%7C?hl=en"",""visitedIn"":null,""likesCount"":0,""reviewerId"":""101839280807278938834"",""reviewerUrl"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101839280807278938834?hl=en"",""isLocalGuide"":true,""reviewOrigin"":""Google"",""reviewContext"":{},""textTranslated"":null,""publishedAtDate"":""2025-04-01T08:25:38.106Z"",""reviewImageUrls"":[],""originalLanguage"":""en"",""reviewerPhotoUrl"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUmNQzWeHLCKm-h9MzcgxC30ZirmK3jiqOGLj9ynLlSU-e5UM7a=s1920-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""translatedLanguage"":null,""reviewDetailedRating"":{},""responseFromOwnerDate"":""2025-04-04T05:42:00.000Z"",""responseFromOwnerText"":""Wow, Micaela — thank you for the amazing review!

We ‘re thrilled to hear your experience at Nundah Village Dental Meet your expectations. Dr Marc loves helping people with their smiles!"",""reviewerNumberOfReviews"":27},{""name"":""Michelle Pullinger"",""text"":""I wanted to share my wonderful experience with Nundah Village Dental. I have a huge phobia of going to the dentist. I am not one to not go, I face it every 6-12 months, but it's a terrible anxiety I have and I struggle to go. I think it's mainly due to some horrendous experiences in the past particularly when I was a child and some awful dentists. Anyway, I have now seen Dr Nermin on 3 separate occasions. From the moment you get in the front door you are greeted by lovely and friendly receptionists, the dental assistants are so welcoming, and the minute I go into the room I'm greeted with a big smile from Dr Nermin, and a friendly chat and she immediately makes me feel at ease. I explained in my first appointment with her about my phobia and she has been nothing but understanding. She communicates and consults with you every step of the way, she tells you exactly what she's doing, gives me a break when I need, takes things slowly if I start getting anxious, allows you to ask questions, shows you everything in your images and explains it to you thoroughly in a way you can understand.\n\nI suffer from vertigo and I recently needed a big filling right at the back of my mouth, so I had to be on a weird angle for the filling to be done. Dr Nermin and her dental assistant Vivienne constantly checked in on me, ensured I had a pillow so I wouldn't feel dizzy, and played the music really loud so I wouldn't be bothered by all the drilling - it was almost like a party :) They were so kind and considerate and I felt totally at ease.\n\nI had to go back a couple of days later as I just needed a part of my tooth a bit more smooth after all the numbness had worn off and before I even laid down Vivienne had the pillow out remembering that I had Vertigo. Whether it was written down in the notes or not, that made me feel like a valued and cared for customer.\n\nWhile I do find this clinic more expensive than others, and I don't get as much back on my private health as I would at a preferred provider, I will continue to spend the extra money and go to this practice given the wonderful treatment I receive and how at ease they make me feel. Thank you so much for showing me there can be great dentists out there who won't make it a traumatic experience."",""stars"":5,""rating"":null,""reviewId"":""ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfajhiWkpBEAE"",""publishAt"":""3 months ago"",""reviewUrl"":""https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfajhiWkpBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4ae61449bbcaff64!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC_j8bZJA%7CCgwI77e2vAYQiO_2ngI%7C?hl=en"",""visitedIn"":null,""likesCount"":0,""reviewerId"":""116684032407874011879"",""reviewerUrl"":""https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116684032407874011879?hl=en"",""isLocalGuide"":false,""reviewOrigin"":""Google"",""reviewContext"":{},""textTranslated"":null,""publishedAtDate"":""2025-01-20T00:42:23.601Z"",""reviewImageUrls"":[],""originalLanguage"":""en"",""reviewerPhotoUrl"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWMcnnesXRwe1KLO3tSk06vjI_UvTaLUCssE1DM_Bw6kWDGPK4=s1920-c-rp-mo-br100"",""translatedLanguage"":null,""reviewDetailedRating"":{},""responseFromOwnerDate"":""2025-02-27T20:48:03.000Z"",""responseFromOwnerText"":""Thank you so much Michelle.
