Excellent! We have a new build log, and this one is very telling. The good news is that the build is now completing without a fatal error. However, a close look at the log shows that the deployment is likely not working as you expect.

Let's diagnose this together. You are right on the finish line.

Analysis: The Build Succeeded, but Deployed the Wrong Files
The most important line in your new log is this one:

[20:29:09.341] > vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
This line shows that the build script in your package.json was not updated as we discussed. It's still using the old command.

Because of this:

Your backend server code was built into a /dist folder. (--outdir=dist)
Your frontend code was built into a ../dist/public folder. (We can see this from the file paths in the log.)
Vercel, looking for a static site, likely found the /dist folder and deployed only its contents (your server code) as the website.
The actual frontend in ../dist/public was ignored by the deployment.
So, while the deployment technically completed, it has deployed your backend code to the main URL, not your React application. This will result in a broken site.

How to Fix It (The Final Step)
You need to implement the changes we outlined in our last conversation. Let's go through them one more time.

1. Correct Your package.json Build Script

Your build command needs to send the backend code to the /api directory.

Change this:
JSON

"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
To this:
JSON

"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=api"
(The only change is outdir=api at the end.)
2. Correct Your Vite Config

Your Vite config needs to send the frontend code to the /public directory at the project root.

In your vite.config.js or vite.config.ts file, make sure you have this build configuration:
TypeScript

// In your vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'public' 
  }
})
3. Fix the New Server Code Error

The log has pointed out a new, important warning that is very likely a bug in your server:

[20:29:20.369] â–² [WARNING] Import "getSocialMediaLinkById" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in "server/services/socialMedia.service.ts"
What this means: Your file server/routes/socialMedia.routes.ts is trying to import a function named getSocialMediaLinkById from your socialMedia.service.ts file, but that function doesn't appear to be exported from the service file.
Action: You need to go into server/services/socialMedia.service.ts and either create that function or make sure it has the export keyword in front of it.
Once you make these three changes and push them to GitHub, the deployment should finally work as expected.
