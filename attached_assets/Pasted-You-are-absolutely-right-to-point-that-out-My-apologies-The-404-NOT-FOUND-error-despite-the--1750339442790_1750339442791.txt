You are absolutely right to point that out. My apologies.

The `404: NOT_FOUND` error, despite the "Deployment completed" message, is a classic Vercel deployment issue. It means that while Vercel successfully built your project, it doesn't know how to route the incoming request for your main URL to a specific file to serve.

The previous log showed a successful *build*, but the `404` error indicates a *routing* or *output* problem.

Based on the information you provided earlier ("✓ Fixed package.json... ✓ Updated vite.config.ts... ✓ Created vercel.json..."), the issue most likely lies within your `vercel.json` configuration or how the build outputs are structured.

Here are the most common causes for this specific 404 error:

1.  **Incorrect `vercel.json` Routing:** This is the most probable cause. Your `vercel.json` file might have incorrect `rewrites` or `routes` that don't properly direct traffic. For a standard Vite + Node.js Express app, you need to:
    * Rewrite all API requests (e.g., `/api/(.*)`) to your main serverless function (e.g., `/api/index.js`).
    * Rewrite all other requests to your frontend's `index.html` file.

2.  **Wrong Output Directory:** Your Vite frontend needs to be built into the `public` directory at the root of the project, as Vercel serves from there by default. Your `vite.config.ts` outputs to `../public`, which could be problematic depending on your project structure. Vercel expects the final frontend assets to be in a directory named `public` at the project root *after* the build.

3.  **Mismatched Serverless Function Path:** The `package.json` script outputs the backend to an `/api` directory. Your `vercel.json` must correctly point to the entry file within that directory (e.g., `api/index.js`). A mismatch between the actual output file path and the path specified in `vercel.json` will cause a 404.

**To fix this, please double-check your `vercel.json` file.** A correct configuration for your setup should look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "backend/api/index.js", // The entry point for your backend
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "package.json", // Assumes frontend build is in root package.json
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "public" // The output directory for your frontend
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/backend/api/index.js" // Route API calls to your backend function
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/public/$1" // Serve frontend files
    }
  ]
}
```
**NOTE:** The `src` and `dest` paths in this example are common structures. You **must** adjust them to match your project's exact file and directory structure.

The `404` error is frustrating, but it almost always comes down to these configuration details. Carefully review your file paths and `vercel.json` rules.
