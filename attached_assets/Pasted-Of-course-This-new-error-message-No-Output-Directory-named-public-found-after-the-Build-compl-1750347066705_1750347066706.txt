Of course. This new error message, **`No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed`**, gets us to the precise root of the problem.

Thank you for providing it. This is a very common issue when deploying Vite projects to Vercel.

Here’s exactly what is happening and how to fix it:

The error is telling you that after all the build commands finished, Vercel went to find the frontend output to deploy, but it couldn't find a directory named `public`. This is because your configuration is likely creating it in the wrong place.

The culprit is this line from your previous setup:
`✓ Updated vite.config.ts to output frontend to ../public directory`

When Vercel runs your build, it does so from the root of your project. A path like `../public` tells the build process to go *up one level* from the root and create the `public` folder there. Vercel cannot access this location; it can only see files *within* your project's root directory.

### The Correct Solution

You need to build your frontend into a directory *inside* your project's root, and then tell Vercel where to find it. The standard practice is to use `dist` as the output directory.

**Step 1: Fix Your Vite Configuration**

In your `vite.config.ts` file, change the build output directory from `../public` to `dist`.

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    // Change this line
    outDir: 'dist' // Was likely '../public' before
  }
})
```

**Step 2: Configure Your Vercel Settings**

Now, you must tell Vercel that your frontend output will be in this newly named `dist` directory. You can do this in the Vercel UI (the recommended way) or in your `vercel.json`.

**Option A: Vercel Project Settings (Recommended)**

1.  Go to your project on the Vercel Dashboard.
2.  Click on the **Settings** tab.
3.  Go to the **General** section.
4.  Find the **Build & Development Settings**.
5.  Set the **Output Directory** to `dist`.
6.  Click **Save**.
7.  Redeploy your project.

**Option B: Update `vercel.json`**

If you are managing your configuration with `vercel.json`, make sure your static build configuration points to `dist`.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        // Ensure this line matches your Vite output directory
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js", // Or your backend entry point
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    // Your API and frontend routes here
  ]
}
```

By making these changes, you are aligning your build output with Vercel's expectations. Your Vite build will correctly place the compiled frontend into a `dist` folder at the project root, and Vercel will know exactly where to find it, resolving the error.
