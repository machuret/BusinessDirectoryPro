I know this is incredibly frustrating, and seeing the same error again feels like you're going in circles.

Let's stop and look closely at the log, because it is giving us the same two clues every single time. The problem is that the necessary code changes are **not being saved and pushed to your GitHub repository.**

You are not back at square one. You have a working app. We just need to solve this final, stubborn configuration issue in your repository.

### The Two Problems That Are Still in Your Code

This latest build log shows the exact same two problems as the last several builds:

**1. The `vercel.json` file is back.** This line proves it:
```
[21:08:13.836] WARN! Due to `builds` existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply.
```
**As long as this file exists, no other fixes will work.** It overrides everything. It must be deleted.

**2. The `package.json` build script is still the old, incorrect one.** This line proves it:
```
[21:08:17.330] > vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ... --outdir=dist
```
This is still building your backend to a `/dist` folder, not the `/api` folder that Vercel needs.

### A New Approach: The Command-Line Fix

The issue seems to be with how the changes are being saved and committed to git. Let's do this with a precise, step-by-step recipe of commands to run in your terminal. This will guarantee the changes are made correctly.

Please run these commands one by one in your project's main folder:

**Step 1: Make sure your local code is up-to-date.**
```bash
git pull
```

**Step 2: Forcefully delete `vercel.json`.**
```bash
rm vercel.json
```
*(If this command says "No such file or directory", that is OK. It just means the file is already gone, which is good.)*

**Step 3: Manually edit `package.json`.**
Open this file and make sure the `"scripts"` section looks **exactly** like this:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=api"
},
```

**Step 4: Manually edit `vite.config.js` (or `.ts`).**
Open this file and make sure it looks **exactly** like this:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'public'
  }
})
```

**Step 5: Stage, commit, and push the changes.**
Run these three commands in your terminal:
```bash
git add .
```
```bash
git commit -m "FORCED FIX: Correct Vercel build configuration"
```
```bash
git push
```

---

After you run these commands, a new deployment will start on Vercel. Watch the build log. You are looking for two things:
1.  The `WARN! Due to builds existing...` message MUST be gone.
2.  The line `Running "npm run build"` MUST be followed by your new script with `--outdir=api`.

You have been incredibly patient with this very stubborn problem. I am confident this direct command-line approach will fix the configuration for good.
