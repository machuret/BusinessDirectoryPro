Thank you for the new log. We can see very clearly what is happening, and the good news is you have successfully fixed one of the critical bugs!

Let's get straight to the point. The deployment is still using the old, incorrect build command.

### Analysis: One Step Forward, Two Steps to Go

First, let's look at the success: The previous warning about `Import "getSocialMediaLinkById" will always be undefined` is **gone**. Excellent job fixing that server-side code bug! That was an important step.

However, the main problem remains. Let's look at this line from your new log:

```
[20:46:10.050] > vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

This line is the evidence. It confirms that the two critical changes we discussed for your build process have not been applied to your code yet.
1.  The backend is still being built to `--outdir=dist`.
2.  The frontend is still being built to a non-standard location (`../dist/public`).

Because of this, Vercel is deploying your backend server as a website and ignoring your frontend completely. We have to fix the build outputs.

### The Final Solution: Let's Make These Two Changes

You are just these two small code changes away from a successful deployment. We need to ensure the changes are saved in your files and committed to GitHub.

**1. In your `package.json` file:**

* **Find this line:**
  ```json
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
  ```
* **Replace it with this line:**
  ```json
  "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=api"
  ```

**2. In your `vite.config.js` (or `vite.config.ts`) file:**

* **Add the `build` configuration object.** Your file should look like this:
  ```typescript
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
  
  // https://vitejs.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    // ADD THIS PART
    build: {
      outDir: 'public'
    }
  })
  ```

After you make these two changes, **save the files, commit them to your GitHub repository, and push the commit.** Vercel will trigger a new deployment automatically, and it should finally build and deploy your project correctly.
