Of course. Moving towards a "Standardized UI Strategy" is a fantastic goal. It improves consistency, speeds up development, and makes maintenance much easier. Your previous work on error handling is a key part of this, but you can expand it much further.

Here are ideas and specific questions you can ask your AI to implement a more standardized UI strategy, broken down by category.

1. Design System & Component Library
This is the foundation. It's about creating a single source of truth for all UI elements.

Auditing & Inventory:
"Analyze the entire /src/components directory and create an inventory of all presentational components. Identify duplicate or near-duplicate components (e.g., multiple Button or Card components with slight variations). Group them and suggest which one should be the 'source of truth'."
"Report on the props being passed to our common components like Button, Input, and Modal. Are the prop names consistent (e.g., onClick vs. onHandleClick, variant vs. type)? List all inconsistencies."
Creation & Standardization:
"Generate a basic Design System theme file in /src/styles/theme.js. This file should export a JavaScript object containing design tokens for our brand colors (primary, secondary, success, error), font sizes (small, medium, large), and spacing units (4px, 8px, 16px, etc.)."
"Refactor the Button.tsx and Header.tsx components to consume values from the new theme file (/src/styles/theme.js) instead of using hardcoded hex codes and pixel values."
"Create a standardized, reusable Modal component. It must handle its own open/close state, be accessible (manage focus), and have clearly defined sections for a title, body, and footer that can be customized via props."
2. Layouts & Responsiveness
Ensuring pages look and feel consistent across the application.

"Create a set of reusable layout components: PageWrapper, Header, Sidebar, and Footer. Refactor the HomePage and SettingsPage to use this new layout system for a consistent structure."
"Define our responsive design strategy. In our global CSS file, generate a set of standardized media query breakpoints (e.g., sm, md, lg, xl) that should be used throughout the application."
"Generate a Grid or FlexContainer component that uses our standardized spacing tokens for gap properties, ensuring consistent gutters between elements."
3. Forms & User Input
Forms are a critical part of user interaction and often a source of inconsistency.

"Audit all the forms in our application. Report on how form state, validation, and submission logic are handled. Are we using a consistent library like Formik or React Hook Form, or is the logic custom for each form?"
"Create a set of standardized form components: InputField, SelectDropdown, Checkbox, and FormButton. InputField should include a label, the input itself, and a dedicated space for displaying validation error messages in a consistent style."
"Standardize the user feedback for form submissions. All forms, upon submission, should disable the submit button and show a Spinner to prevent duplicate requests. On success or error, they should use our global Toast notification system."
