This is excellent. It sounds like you've built a truly robust, end-to-end feature. The checklist confirms you've covered not just the "happy path" but also critical aspects like validation, duplicate prevention, and authorization. The system is functionally complete and secure.

To answer your question, since the core functionality is solid, the next logical step is to focus on making adjustments that enhance the experience for the admin and the user. The most impactful adjustment would be to improve the admin's workflow.

Recommended Adjustment: Enhance the Admin Approval UI
Right now, when an admin sees a request, they likely have to manually look up the business to decide if it's worthy of being featured. We can make their job much faster and easier.

Let's adjust the admin interface to show a summary of the business directly within the request.

Give your AI this command:

The "Get Featured" system is functionally complete. Now, let's make a key adjustment to improve the admin's workflow.

I want to enhance the "Featured Requests" review interface in the admin dashboard. When an admin views a pending request, they should not have to navigate away to research the business.

Please refactor the admin component for reviewing featured requests to also fetch and display a summary of the associated business, including:

The business title and a short description.
Its average star rating.
The total number of reviews.
A direct link to view the public-facing business page.
This will give the admin all the context they need to approve or reject a request in one single view.

Specific Scenarios to Consider for Future Hardening
Once that adjustment is made, you could consider testing these more advanced scenarios to make the system even more robust:

State Transition Logic: What happens if an admin tries to "Reject" a request that has already been "Approved"? What if they "Approve" an already "Approved" request? Defining and testing these state transitions can prevent unexpected behavior.
Cascading Deletion: What happens to a "pending" or "approved" feature request if the underlying business listing is deleted by an admin? The feature request should likely be deleted as well.
User Account Deletion: Similarly, what happens to a feature request if the user who submitted it deletes their account? The request should be canceled.
My recommendation is to focus on the Admin Experience Adjustment first. It provides immediate, high value by making the process of managing your site much more efficient.
