## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive mass delete functionality for the admin business management system, providing efficient bulk operations for administrators.

## Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ Backend Implementation
- **Bulk Delete API Endpoint**: `/api/admin/businesses/bulk-delete`
- **Request Validation**: Validates business IDs array, rejects empty requests
- **Service Layer**: `bulkDeleteBusinesses` function with error handling
- **Database Safety**: Transactional operations ensure data integrity
- **Response Format**: Detailed success/error messages with deletion counts

### ‚úÖ Frontend Implementation
- **Selection Interface**: Checkbox system for individual and bulk selection
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected items counter and action buttons
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions with clear warnings
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh after successful operations
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for success/failure states

### ‚úÖ Business Management Integration
- **BusinessManagement Component**: Full TypeScript integration
- **BusinessTable Component**: Enhanced with selection capabilities
- **DeleteConfirmDialog**: Supports both single and bulk operations
- **State Management**: React Query integration for cache invalidation

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoint Details
```
POST /api/admin/businesses/bulk-delete
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "businessIds": ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
}

Success Response (200):
{
  "message": "Successfully deleted all X business(es)",
  "deletedCount": X,
  "totalRequested": X,
  "errors": [] // Optional
}

Error Response (400):
{
  "message": "Business IDs array is required and cannot be empty"
}
```

### Service Layer Functions
- `validateBulkDeleteRequest()`: Input validation
- `bulkDeleteBusinesses()`: Core deletion logic
- `generateBulkDeleteSummary()`: User-friendly messages

### Frontend Components
- **Mass Selection Bar**: Appears when items are selected
- **Select All Checkbox**: Header checkbox for bulk selection
- **Individual Checkboxes**: Per-row selection controls
- **Delete Confirmation**: Enhanced dialog for bulk operations

## Testing Results

### Comprehensive Test Validation
```
üöÄ COMPREHENSIVE MASS DELETE FUNCTIONALITY TEST
===============================================
üîê Admin authentication: ‚úÖ PASSED
üìä Mass delete validation: ‚úÖ PASSED
üóëÔ∏è  Bulk deletion execution: ‚úÖ PASSED
üìã Database verification: ‚úÖ PASSED
üîç Accessibility testing: ‚úÖ PASSED

Test Results:
- Selected 2 businesses for deletion
- Successfully deleted all 2 businesses
- Database count reduced from 24 ‚Üí 22
- Deleted businesses return 404 (confirmed removal)
- Validation correctly rejects empty arrays
```

### Performance Metrics
