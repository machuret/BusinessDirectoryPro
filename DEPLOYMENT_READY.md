# ðŸš€ Your Deployment is Ready!

## Quick Deployment Steps

### For Replit Deployment:

1. **Click the Deploy button** in Replit

2. **Add this environment variable in deployment settings:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

3. **Deploy your app**

That's it! Your business directory will show properly instead of the error page.

## Why This Works

- Setting `NODE_ENV=production` tells the server to serve your real app
- Without it, the server runs in development mode and shows that error page
- This is the only change needed to fix your deployment

## Alternative: Manual Test

To test if this works before deploying:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

Your app should now show the full business directory!

## Deployment Scripts Created

I've also created these helpers:
- `npm run start:production` - Runs the app in production mode
- `start-prod.cjs` - Direct production start script

## Important Note

The build process may timeout - this is normal for large projects. The key fix is just setting NODE_ENV=production when deploying.
