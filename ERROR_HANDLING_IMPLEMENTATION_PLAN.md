# Error Handling Implementation Plan - Strategic Refactoring
*Analysis of ~40 remaining components needing error handling updates*

## Executive Summary
After implementing core error handling infrastructure (useApiQuery hook, NetworkStatusBanner, SectionErrorBoundary), 40+ components require refactoring to use standardized error handling patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED âœ“)
- [x] `useApiQuery` hook with intelligent error handling
- [x] `NetworkStatusBanner` for connectivity monitoring  
- [x] `SectionErrorBoundary` for component isolation
- [x] Demonstration pattern in `similar-businesses-carousel`

### Phase 2: Critical Path (Week 1)
**Focus**: Batch 1 - Critical User Flows
- Start with `business-detail-refactored.tsx` (highest traffic)
- Implement `search-results.tsx` and `search-bar.tsx` together
- Address `add-business.tsx` and `login.tsx` for user actions

### Phase 3: Content Experience (Week 2)  
**Focus**: Batch 2 - Business Content & Discovery
- Business detail components as a group
- Content discovery pages collectively
- Image and media components

### Phase 4: User Management (Week 3)
**Focus**: Batch 3 - User Dashboard & Management
- Dashboard and portal pages
- Business management workflows

### Phase 5: Admin Tools (Week 4)
**Focus**: Batch 4 - Admin Operations
- Process admin pages in logical groups
- Lower priority due to internal-only impact

### Phase 6: Polish (Week 5)
**Focus**: Batch 5 - Specialized Features
- Complete remaining components
- Comprehensive testing

## Success Metrics

### Error Reduction Targets
- **Batch 1**: 90% reduction in user-facing errors
- **Batch 2**: 85% reduction in content loading failures  
- **Batch 3**: 80% reduction in dashboard errors
- **Batch 4**: 75% reduction in admin operation failures
- **Batch 5**: 70% reduction in specialized feature errors

### Performance Indicators
- Time to recovery from network issues
- User satisfaction with error messaging
- Reduction in support tickets related to errors
- Developer efficiency in debugging issues

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Standardized Pattern for Each Component:
1. Replace `useQuery` with `useApiQuery`
2. Add error state handling in UI
3. Implement loading states
4. Add retry mechanisms where appropriate
5. Wrap complex sections with `SectionErrorBoundary`

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] Uses `useApiQuery` for all data fetching
- [ ] Handles `isError`, `isNotFound`, and `isLoading` states
- [ ] Provides user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Includes retry functionality where appropriate
- [ ] Has appropriate fallback UI
- [ ] Wrapped in error boundaries where needed

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- Maintain feature flags for error handling toggles
- Keep original implementations as backup
- Gradual rollout by user percentage

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for error scenarios
- Integration tests for error boundaries
- Load testing for error recovery
- User acceptance testing for error UX

## Resource Allocation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 60-76 hours
- **Critical (Batch 1)**: 12-16 hours (Week 1)
- **High Priority (Batches 2-3)**: 24-30 hours (Weeks 2-3)  
- **Medium/Low Priority (Batches 4-5)**: 24-30 hours (Weeks 4-5)

**Team Assignment Recommendation**:
- Senior developer: Batches 1-2 (critical user flows)
- Mid-level developer: Batch 3 (user management)
- Junior developer: Batches 4-5 (admin tools, guided by senior)

This strategic approach ensures maximum user impact with minimal development risk, addressing the most critical user flows first while building toward comprehensive error handling coverage.
