- Error handling and display
- Form reset after submission

### 4. API Integration Tests

#### API Endpoints (`server/test/api.test.ts`)
âœ… **Coverage:** All major API endpoints, error handling, performance
- Authentication endpoints (login, logout, user data)
- Business endpoints (list, featured, random, by ID, by slug)
- Category endpoints (list, by slug)
- Review endpoints (get, create)
- Search functionality
- Error handling for non-existent resources
- Performance benchmarks (response times under 1 second)
- Concurrent request handling

- Automatic cleanup between tests

### Custom Test Utilities
- Provider wrapper for React Query, UI Context, and Tooltips
- Mock data factories for consistent test data
- Type-safe mock business and user objects
- Reusable component rendering function

### Performance Testing
- Response time validation (< 1 second)
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory leak prevention with cleanup

### Error Handling Tests
- 404 responses for non-existent resources
- Malformed request handling
- Network error simulation
- Authentication failure scenarios
