# Fix Your Deployment - Simple Instructions

## The Problem
Your deployment is showing a basic error page instead of your real business directory because:
- The server is running in development mode
- Production build files are missing

## The Solution

### Step 1: Build Production Files
Run this command (it may take 2-3 minutes):
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy with Production Mode
When deploying on Replit, set this environment variable:
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

### For Replit Deployment:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. In deployment settings, add environment variable:
   - Key: `NODE_ENV`
   - Value: `production`
3. Deploy your app

### Alternative Quick Test:
To test if this fixes the issue, you can run:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## What This Fixes
- Your app will serve the actual business directory
- No more "Service Unavailable" errors
- The app will look and work exactly like in development

## Important Notes
- The build process may timeout - this is normal for large projects
- If build fails, the deployment can still work with the development files
- The key is setting NODE_ENV=production
