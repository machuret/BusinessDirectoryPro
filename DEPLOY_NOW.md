# Deploy Your Business Directory to Vercel

## The Real Issue
You haven't deployed to Vercel yet. The 404 error shows "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" - meaning no deployment exists.

## Deploy Now (2 options):

### Option 1: GitHub + Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push this code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Click "Import Project" 
4. Select your GitHub repo
5. Deploy automatically

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## Your Files Are Ready:
- `api/index.js` - Working serverless function
- `vercel.json` - Correct configuration
- All endpoints configured

## After Deployment:
Test: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`

Stop configuring. Start deploying.
