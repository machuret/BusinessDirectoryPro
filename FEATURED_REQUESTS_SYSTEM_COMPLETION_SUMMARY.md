## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE featured_requests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  business_id VARCHAR NOT NULL REFERENCES businesses(placeid),
  user_id VARCHAR NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  status VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  message TEXT,
  admin_message TEXT,
  reviewed_by VARCHAR REFERENCES users(id),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/featured-requests` - Submit new request
- `GET /api/featured-requests/user/:userId` - User's requests
- `GET /api/featured-requests` - Admin: All requests (filtered)
- `PUT /api/featured-requests/:id` - Admin: Update status
- `GET /api/featured-requests/:id` - Request details

### Component Structure
```typescript
FeaturedRequestsSection
├── Request Submission Dialog
├── Status Display Cards
├── Loading States
├── Empty States
└── Error Handling
```
