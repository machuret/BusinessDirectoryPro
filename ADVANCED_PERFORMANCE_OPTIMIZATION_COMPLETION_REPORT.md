## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Optimistic UI Architecture
```typescript
// Immediate UI feedback with rollback capability
const { mutateOptimistic, isOptimistic } = useOptimisticReview();

// Updates UI instantly, handles errors gracefully
mutateOptimistic(reviewData, {
  onSuccess: () => trackInteraction('review_submission', startTime),
  onError: () => rollbackToOriginalState()
});
```

### Prefetching Strategy
```typescript
// Smart hover-based prefetching
const { prefetchBusiness } = useBusinessPrefetch();

onMouseEnter={() => {
  prefetchBusiness(businessId); // 200ms delay
  prefetchBusinessReviews(businessId); // 400ms delay
}}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Automatic Core Web Vitals tracking
usePerformanceMonitoring({
  reportUrl: '/api/analytics/performance',
  sampleRate: 0.1, // 10% of users
  debug: isDevelopment
});
```

### Image Optimization
```typescript
// Modern image loading with lazy loading
<OptimizedImage
  src={imageUrl}
  alt={description}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  priority={isAboveFold}
  placeholder="blur"
/>
```
